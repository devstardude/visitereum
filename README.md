## 🛣️ Why I built this application

- Because of my deep interest in blockchain technologies, I was facinated by the concept of Decentralised Identity. Because the user is in total control of his data, it has potential to change the traditional way of authentication and profile management on Internet.
- Wanted to turn Web 2 version of my previously built application into a decentralised Web 3 version with similar features.
